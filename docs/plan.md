# The biggest risk for my website would be time management and creating a user friendly interface. Time management, well because there has to be a due date and lets say people want to procrastinate then we run the risk of not completing everything the day we need it. As for the interface if it isn’t user friendly then the webpage won’t pull in the audience and wont get populated. In order to avoid this we can probably transfer some work onto others in order to evenly split the work so it gets done on time. We could also eliminate some options such as adding any unnecessary pictures or navigation links to the website so that way everything can look more organized. We can also mitigate the problem by asking friends or family to test out the page and see what they think and get opinions on what can be done to make the site look more polished
