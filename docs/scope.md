# Project Name: ***PlayStation & Xbox Games Showcase*** 
***
### Project Purpose:

#### The purpose of this project is to show some of the games, from the early PlayStation and Xbox era, that I played in my early childhood for a bit of nostalgia and to practice my web development skills
***
### Description:

#### This project will highlight some of the best games to come out in the early 2000's that the Xbox and PlayStation had. I simply want to showcase some of the ones I loved to play as well.
***
### Desired Results:

#### I want to better my skills at making webpages and practice html to see what I can make. I know the basics, but maybe I can add more advanced things like different backgrounds and trying different fonts.
***
### Exclusions:

#### Any games that aren't from the PlayStation or Xbox won't be included. Nothing past 2018 since that's when i graduated and barely had any time to play.
***
### Priorities:

#### Finding the games, focusing on coding the page as well as how the interface will look and how i will organize the games. Potentially ordering them by date released or name.
***
### Acceptance Criteria:

#### I have to have a good list of games I played pretty often. More than likely it'll be games from the early 2000's. It can be any games from ps1 to ps4 and the original Xbox to Xbox360 since I didn't play too much on the newer Xbox consoles.
