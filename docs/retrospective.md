# RETROSPECTIVE

### For this proposal what went really well was figuring out what to do. I think the option of picking hobbies and such helped me narrow down what I was thinking of doing especially with being a bit burned out from my other class. I also think My time management was very well utilized. I don’t know if it was because I was stressing but I made a plan to complete certain things on certain days and managed to actually do a lot of work in the beginning of the week. That being said though I was extremely stressed out since I had another project to work on and although I did do a good job managing my time, the stress was making me cry at some points. (I’m also a bit moody while writing this so that doesn’t help my case lol). that isn’t to say I hated working on the project but I think I was overwhelmed most of the time and if I could do anything differently next time is not let anxiety get to my head. I didn’t let it really hinder me from my project but it did complicate things and make me feel like a lot of my woRk wasn’t good enough. So i Need to work on not doubting myself for the next time!
